# ESDL-importer 

ESDL Importer is an open source tool created by Maarten Bastiaanse and changed by Mels Habold for ZEnMo. This tool allows you to import ESDL files into Anylogic using a two layer model. The UI layer provides the user with a simple interface to import, configure and manage ESDL files, while the underlying model layer handles the actual ESDL import process.

## Getting Started

To get started, download the latest version of the ESDL Importer from the website. Once downloaded, double-click the file to install the tool on your computer.

## Using the Tool

Once installed, you can launch the ESDL Importer from the Windows Start Menu. The UI will open and you can begin to configure the tool and manage your ESDL files.
